decide on max level for the game (since it sets curve)
set level 1 player HP
set max level player HP
set average combat length
derive player DPR
workshop monster damage formula (function of combat length and player HP -> lethality)
rough concept of how skills work
action design is probably: main action, move action, reaction (1 turn / round/ both?), any number of free actions
character based initiative, be able to drop initiative to combo with specific ally
design utility spells
design *a* set of character abilties for the narrative equivalent of 5e levels 3 through 5~6
Design classes:
- the tankiest guy
- the most melee damage (burst vs dpr?)
- the most AoE damage
- the most fragile
- the most ranged single target damage
- summoner (single thing? horde?)
- the biggest healer
- the biggest buffer


- tanky armored melee dude that defends people (knight)
- melee single target damage king rogue (assassin)
- archer damage (archer)
- aoe damage mage glass cannon (pyromancer)
- control mage (enchanter)
- healing cleric (life cleric)
