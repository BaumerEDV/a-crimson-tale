decide on max level for the game (since it sets curve)
set level 1 player HP
set max level player HP
set average combat length
derive player DPR
do math how much damage dailies are allowed to do and how that relates to encounter poowers
workshop monster damage formula (function of combat length and player HP -> lethality)
rough concept of how skills work
action design is probably: main action, move action, reaction (1 turn / round/ both?), any number of free actions
character based initiative, be able to drop initiative to combo with specific ally
design utility spells
design *a* set of character abilties for the narrative equivalent of 5e levels 3 through 5~6
Design classes:
- [X] the tankiest guy
- [X] the most melee damage (burst vs dpr?)
- [X] the most AoE damage
- [X] the most fragile
- [X] the most ranged single target damage
- [X] best control
- [X] summoner (single thing? horde?)
- [X] the biggest healer


- tanky armored melee dude that defends people (knight) {tankiest guy}
- assassin (most melee damage)
- archer (most ranged single target)
- pyromancer (most aoe damage, most fragile)
- control mage / enchanter (most fragile, best controller)
- healing cleric (holy priest, best healer)
- necromancer (summons skellies) (summoner)
