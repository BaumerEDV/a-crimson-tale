## Overarching Goal
- LOOSELY OSR compatible (some conversion can be required)
- PCs have cool abilities (diablo, world of warcraft, 4e dnd flavour text)
- Pen and Paper compatible
## Goals
- it should be easy to ad-hoc encounters
- out of combat gameplay matters
- character expertise is represented in the skill system
- every level is meaningful
- expedition based resource management
- build around a WWN Effort-esque mechanic (use powers from a pool that can be spent continuously, for the fight, for the expedition)
- make sure "ability picks" are not strongly diminishing returns
- quickly convert OSR monsters / adventures to this game
- have a relationship of OSR level to this game level so people know the adventures to run
- monsters are simple, complexity in statblocks is reserved for iconic abilities
- players need to not be too squishy at level 1
- single encounters need to be threatening (there needs to be a risk of death / being downed)
- one encounter days are interesting
- meaningful durability differences
## Sensible things to do
- fuck multiclassing, focus on strong, designed classes
- most mundane martial abilities do not consume resources for the expedition (but do give them some ability to burst)
- rests with meaningful recovery only in safe places (can create safe places with outposts)
- define mathematical limits of combat early
## Invariants
- a party of AoE characters doesn't oneshot a boss -> this means AoEs must do less than 25% boss HP damage
- expedition based resource management doesn't implode in city contexts -> presumably regenerate a fixed but not full amount of expedition resources on a safe rest
- adventuring day length doesn't explode exponentially with levels (avoid resource bloat / multiplicative scaling i.e. LEVEL uses for LEVEL damage)
