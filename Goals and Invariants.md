## Overarching Goal
- LOOSELY OSR compatible (some conversion can be required)
- PCs have cool abilities (diablo, world of warcraft, 4e dnd flavour text)
- Pen and Paper compatible
## Goals
- it should be easy to ad-hoc encounters
- out of combat gameplay matters
- character expertise is represented in the skill system
- every level is meaningful
- expedition based resource management
- build around a WWN Effort-esque mechanic (use powers from a pool that can be spent continuously, for the fight, for the expedition)
- make sure "ability picks" are not strongly diminishing returns
- quickly convert OSR monsters / adventures to this game
- have a relationship of OSR level to this game level so people know the adventures to run
- monsters are simple, complexity in statblocks is reserved for iconic abilities
- players need to not be too squishy at level 1
- single encounters need to be threatening (there needs to be a risk of death / being downed)
- one encounter days are interesting -> investigate if daily power spending needs to be limited
- meaningful durability differences
## Sensible things to do
- fuck multiclassing, focus on strong, designed classes
- most mundane martial abilities do not consume resources for the expedition (but do give them some ability to burst)
- rests with meaningful recovery only in safe places (can create safe places with outposts)
- define mathematical limits of combat early
## Invariants
- no magic item walmart
- a party of AoE characters doesn't oneshot a boss -> this means AoEs must do less than 25% boss HP damage
- expedition based resource management doesn't implode in city contexts -> presumably regenerate a fixed but not full amount of expedition resources on a safe rest
- adventuring day length doesn't explode exponentially with levels (avoid resource bloat / multiplicative scaling i.e. LEVEL uses for LEVEL damage)
- do not use term level for different things


## super loose
- range sacrifices movement for its damage
- there's a potential to limit / prescribe the set of effort using modalities a class picks (i.e. 2 passives, 2 per scene, 5 daily)
- shield healing
- group attack action easier to run than WWN swarm attack
- special not-classes that are a set of arts that can be applied to a closed set of defined classes (i.e. a set of dragonknight powers that can be used by fighters or barbarians) - probably limit a character to one of those sets
- very likely want a charge action
-  very likely want a run action for 3-4x movement 
- very likely want no penalty on a charge or run




## research questions 
magic items
how do weapons work
does damage on a miss affect punching up
how do you balance zone powers that do repeated damage
how do you balance powers that unlock an action option to do repeat damage
when should repeat saves happen / effects end
