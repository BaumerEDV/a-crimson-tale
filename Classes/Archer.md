# Power options
## Passive
- shoot further with bows than other characters can
- see better at long distances
- overall higher accuracy (need to offset damage)
## At-Will
- normal attack vs better attack for which you have to stand still
## Scene
- stunning melee strike with the bow
- shot with knockback
- arrow to the knee slow/ prone
- rapid fire shots
- grappling arrow
## Expedition
- sniper shot for a bunch of damage
- counterspell shot to interrupt casters
- trickshot item out of enemy's hand (should be at least scene power so it doesn't get spammed too too much)
# Ability Ideas
- hail of arrows / aoe attack
- blinding arrow
- arrow with extra damage against wounded people
- curve arrow around cover
- turn miss into hit
- shoot and kite
- increasing damage for subsequent hits
- hit with your eyes closed
- poisoned arrow with damage over time
- some movement speed / get out of jail free card (not sure that movement should be part of a core archer identity rather than a hunter type, though maybe archer should just be hunter)
