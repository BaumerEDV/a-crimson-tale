## Ability Ideas
- sniper shot for a bunch of damage
- shot with knockback
- rapid fire shots
- stunning melee strike with the bow
- hail of arrows / aoe attack
- arrow to the knee slow/ prone
- blinding arrow
- arrow with extra damage against wounded people
- curve arrow around cover
- turn miss into hit
- trickshot item out of enemy's hand (should be at least scene power so it doesn't get spammed too too much)
- shoot and kite
- shoot further with bows than other characters can
- see better at long distances
- normal attack vs better attack for which you have to stand still
- increasing damage for subsequent hits
- hit with your eyes closed
- overall higher accuracy (need to offset damage)
- poisoned arrow with damage over time
- some movement speed / get out of jail free card (not sure that movement should be part of a core archer identity rather than a hunter type, though maybe archer should just be hunter)
- counterspell shot to interrupt casters
- grappling arrow
