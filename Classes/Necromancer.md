# Abilities
## Passive
### Guardian at Death's Door
You have a say about the strands of fate. You can stabilize or kill dying creatures within your presence.

## Always Available
### Spectral Claw
You summon a spectral, floating claw, about 4 feet in size. On your turn you can move it up to 120 feet. You can only have one spectral claw at a time (summoning a new one makes the old one vanish). You can attack with the claw in the following way:
Action: Main Action
Melee Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8+2 damage and the target cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.
### Ray of Sickness
Action: Main Action
Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8 damage and the target must succeed a Physical Save or have disadvantage on attacks until the start of your next turn.
### Cause Fear
Action: Main Action
Mental Save
Fail: The target is frightened of you, causing it to have disadvantage on attacks until the start of your next turn.

## Per Scene
### Claws of the Grave
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Effect: in a 20x20 foot area within 90 feet, claws rise from the ground and attempt to ensnare the living. All living creatures in the area must succeed on a Reflex save or they are grabbed by the claws, reducing their speed to 0 and taking 2 damage. Creatures can repeat the save at the start of your turns to free themselves.
### Spectral Scythe
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Effect: Creatures in a 15x15 square directly in front of you take d6+2 damage from a spectral scythe cutting through them, a physical save prevents the damage.
### Blindness
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Will Save
Fail: Target is blinded until the start of your next turn.

## Per Expedition
### Fear
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed a Mental Save or spend their turns fleeing from you. A repeat save at the start of your turns ends the effect.
This ability provokes Attacks of Opportunity. The effect also ends if they take damage.
### Turn Undead
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed a Mental Save or spend their turns fleeing from you for the rest of the scene. The effect ends if they take damage. Undead with 1HD are destroyed utterly on a failed save.
### Summon Skeletal Archer
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: While the Effort spent on this ability remains spent, you can summon a Skeletal Archer (described below) as a Free Action at the cost of 1 SS. You can only have 1 Skeletal archer per Effort spent in this way at a time, though you can have multiple Skeletal Archers if you spend multiple points of Effort on this ability. Skeletal Archers act on your turn; they attack jointly: attacking the same target and using only one attack roll (which is used to resolve all their attacks).
Skeletal Archer: uses your to-hit and AC; 6 HP (counts as 1HD); 2 damage on a hit
