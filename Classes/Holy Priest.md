# Abilities

### Prayer of Healing
When healing via First Aid between scenes, allies near you regain 3 extra HP per SS they spend.

## Always Available
### Smite
Action: Main Action
Ranged Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8+2 damage
### Seal of Damnation
Action: Main Action
Will Save
Fail: Attacks against the target have  a +3 bonus until the start of your next turn. 
### Mending
Action: Main Action
Effect: Repair an item with damage no larger than a foot across.

## Per Scene
### Command: Grovel!
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Will Save
Fail: Target falls prone and stays prone until the start of your next turn (at which point they can choose to get up at the start of your turn). Note that they can still attack while prone.
### Sanctuary
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Effect: Choose an ally. For the rest of the scene: When a monster attempts to harm that ally, the monster must succeed on a Will Save to do so, if they fail, they hesitate and waste the rest of their turn. This effect ends if your ally attempts to harm a creature - including with established persistent effects (such as a wall of fire).
### Searing Light
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8 damage and the target is blinded until the start of your next turn.
### Cure Wounds

Action: Main Action
Effect: A target adjacent to you may spend 2 SS to heal d8+3, or 4 SS to heal twice as much.
### Mass Healing Word

Action: Main Action
Effect: Creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you may spend 2 SS to heal d4+1, or 4 SS to heal twice as much.

## Per Expedition
### Hold Monster
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Will Save
Fail: Creature is paralyzed. Repeats the save at the start of your turns. 
This ability provokes Attacks of Opportunity.
### Dispel Magic
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: End a magical effect within 150 feet. Some permanent enchantments are too strong to be ended this way; these might either be suppressed for a minute or utterly unaffected - some might require a check. If an effect is utterly immune to being dispelled, you regain your Effort, but not your action.
### Lesser Restoration
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: Cure a poison, disease, or a negative effect causing blindness, paralysis, reduced speed or similar. This ability cannot end petrification, curses, or congenital illness.
### Daylight
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: Hostile creatures adjacent to you must succeed on a Physical Save or be blinded for the encounter. You summon a globe that emits bright daylight in a 300 foot radius. The globe follows your movement and remains close to you.
### Wall of Light
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: You summon a wall of light 30 feet high and 60 feet long and 1 inch thick within 120 feet of you. The wall is a straight line. The wall sheds bright light within 60 feet of it. A creature inside the area when the wall appears, a creature that enters the area, or a creature that ends its turn in the area takes 2d8 damage. Also, such creatures must succeed on a Physical save or be blinded - they can repeat the save at the start of your turn to end the effect.
As a Main Action on subsequent turns, you can shoot a beam of light from the wall (Attack Roll vs AC) for 2d8 damage, this decreases the length of the wall by 10 feet. When the wall is gone, you can no longer shoot light from it.
This ability provokes Attacks of Opportunity.
