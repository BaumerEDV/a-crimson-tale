**Damage**: highest
**Defense**: lowest

# Abilities
## Passive
### Fire Incarnate
You are immune to fire.
Your abilities ignore other creatures' resistance and immunity to fire.

## Always Available
### Firebolt
Action: Main Action
Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: 2d8 damage; if targeted at an object, can set it on fire if plausible.
### Cauterize
Action: Main Action
Requires target to have been wounded
Pysical Save
Fail: 2d10 damage and any bleeding effect on the target ends.
Alternatively you can target a friendly creature and end a bleeding effect on them without damage or save.
### Create Bonfire
Action: Main Action
Effect: Create a 10x10x10 feet bonfire within 90 feet, which persists for the rest of the encounter. A creature in the area when it appears, a creature that enters the area, and a creature that ends its turn in the area takes 3 damage. If you create a second bonfire, the first one vanishes.
It is straining to persist the bonfire for long times, thus it is challenging to substitute the need for fire wood while traveling; though at the expense of 1 Effort for the Expedition or 4 SS, you can keep a fire burning for the entire night - though you will be unable to sleep and will suffer the appropriate consequences.

## Per Scene
### Meteor Crown
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Free Action
Effect: Tiny meteors circle around your head for the remainder of the scene, allowing you the following action option:

Action: Free Action, though no more than once per round
Effect: Hurl the meteor at a point within 90 feet, where it explodes in a 10x10 foot area. Enemies there take 2 damage.
### Phoenix Flame
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Ranged Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: 2d8 damage
Hit or Miss: You can make this attack again against a target within 15 feet of the first - this attack does not bounce again.
### Immolate
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Physical Save
Fail: Target is set on fire and takes 2d8 damage. It continues to take 2d8 damage at the start of every one of your turns. Flames can be doused as an action by the burning creature; or by an adjacent creature, which takes 1d8 damage in the process (if it dies to that damage, the dousing fails).

## Per Expedition
### PYROBLAST!
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Ranged Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: 3d12 DAMAGE!
Miss: regain the spent Effort
This ability provokes Attacks of Opportunity.
### Fireball
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: Hurl a fireball, exploding in a 30 foot radius sphere within 120 feet. Creatures inside the sphere take 2d6 damage, with a Reflex Save to halve the damage taken.
This ability provokes Attacks of Opportunity.
### Counterflame
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Reaction, when you see a spell being cast
Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8 damage and the spell is interrupted
