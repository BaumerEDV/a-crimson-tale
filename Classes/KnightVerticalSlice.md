- If an enemy adjacent to you attacks someone other than you, they provoke an Attack of Opportunity from you.
- If an enemy moves within your reach (as opposed to just moving out of your reach), they provoke an Attack of Opportunity from you.

## Always Available
### Leading Strike
Melee Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: **LOW** damage and move target 5ft
### Maneuvering Strike
Melee Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: **LOW** damage and move to any free space adjacent to the target - you can move through enemy spaces and do not provoke Attacks of Opportunity with this movement.
