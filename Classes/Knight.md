# Abilities
## Passive
### Guardian
Hits with your Attacks of Opportunity reduce the target's speed to 0 until the start of your next turn.
If an enemy adjacent to you attacks someone other than you, they provoke an Attack of Opportunity from you.
If an enemy moves within your reach (as opposed to just moving out of your reach), they provoke an Attack of Opportunity from you.

## Always Available
### Leading Strike
Melee Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8 damage and move target 5ft
### Maneuvering Strike
Melee Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8 damage and move to any free space adjacent to the target - you can move through enemy spaces and do not provoke Attacks of Opportunity with this movement. 

## Per Scene
### Get Down!
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Reaction, when an ally you could move adjacent to with a move action is hit by an attack.
Effect: Move adjacent to that ally without provoking Attacks of Opportunity and catch the attack with your shield. If the initial hit roll would miss you, the attack misses, otherwise, you suffer the effects of the attack.  
### Strike!
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Effect: Command an ally to use one of their at-will attacks.
### On my Mark!
Effort: spend Effort for the scene
Action: Main Action
Melee Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: d8 damage and attacks against the target have +3 until the start of your next turn.

## Per Expedition
### Reposition!
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Main Action
Effect: All allies within your presence, including yourself, may move up to their speed without provoking Attacks of Opportunity.
### Second Wind
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Reaction, which you take when you want, but no more than once per round.
Effect: Heal by a quarter of your maximum HP.
### Interrupt
Effort: spend Effort for the Expedition
Action: Reaction, which you can take when a creature you can move to casts a spell.
Effect: You move to that creature (this movement *does* provoke Attacks of Opportunity) and attack it (Melee Attack Roll vs AC).
Hit: d8 damage and the spell is interrupted.


# Draft Notes from here on out

DPR: low (but reactions)
DEF: highest
# Powers
## Passive
- AoOs reduce enemy speed to zero and keep them there
- reaction attacks for hitting someone else / sentinel
- get AoOs for people moving within your range rather than just leaving
- skill proficiencies / competences associated with knighthood (riding, writing, persuasion, athleticism)
## At-Will
- at will attack that allows to push back / maneuver enemy around
- strike and move around an enemy without taking aoos (but stay adjacent to enemy)
## Scene
- interpose shield to take an attack for an ally
- command ally to strike? (somewhat of a balance concern?)
- your attack makes the enemy easier to attack
## Expedition
- command allies to move without taking AoOs
- second wind healing
- punitive strike for counterspelling
# Ability Ideas
- get a horsey (later unicorn?)
- compelled duel?
- inspire in some form, temp hp? improved saves?
- immunity to charm / mind control (incorruptible knights)
- succeed on a save for daily effort / in domitable
- cleave attack
- know where blind enemies are (super good defender)
- lunge attack with increased range
- swap place with ally
- rally / *heal* allies?
- jump further / higher, carry more
- vigilance / initiative boost (maybe even for everyone)
- knock enemy down with charge attack
- last stand, take a turn before going down
- allow ally to re-save against an effect
- reduce incoming damage
- strike & fear enemy
- strike with daze on  a hit
- call ally to you (they can move and gain an AC bonus for a round)
- attack with knockback and or prone
- better charge attacks
