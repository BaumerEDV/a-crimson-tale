## Ability Ideas
- interpose shield to take an attack for an ally

- compelled duel?
- inspire in some form, temp hp? improved saves?
- immunity to charm / mind control (incorruptible knights)
- succeed on a save for daily effort / in domitable
- reaction attacks for hitting someone else / sentinel
- AoOs reduce enemy speed to zero and keep them there
- at will attack that allows to push back / maneuver enemy around
- cleave attack
- know where blind enemies are (super good defender)
- command ally to strike? (somewhat of a balance concern?)
- lunge attack with increased range
- swap place with ally
- get AoOs for people moving within your range rather than just leaving
- rally / *heal* allies?
- skill proficiencies / competences associated with knighthood (riding, writing, persuasion, athleticism)
- jump further / higher, carry more
- vigilance / initiative boost (maybe even for everyone)
- knock enemy down with charge attack
- last stand, take a turn before going down
- command allies to move without taking AoOs
- allow ally to re-save against an effect
- reduce incoming damage
- strike & fear enemy
- strike with daze on  a hit
- call ally to you (they can move and gain an AC bonus for a round)
- your attack makes the enemy easier to attack
- attack with knockback and or prone
- punitive strike for counterspelling
- better charge attacks
- strike and move around an enemy without taking aoos (but stay adjacent to enemy)
