# Core Abilities
You gain the following abilities, note that you also have one ability pick to make in [Learned Abilities](#LearnedAbilties)
## Passive
### Fire Incarnate
You are immune to fire.
Your abilities ignore other creatures' resistance and immunity to fire.

## Always Available
### Firebolt
Action: Main Action
Attack Roll vs AC
Hit: **LOW** damage; if targeted at an object, can set it on fire if plausible.
### Cauterize
Action: Main Action
Requires target to have been wounded
Pysical Save
Fail: **LOW** + **INCIDENTAL** damage and any bleeding effect on the target ends.
Alternatively you can target a friendly creature and end a bleeding effect on them without damage or save.
### Create Bonfire
Action: Main Action
Effect: Create a 10x10x10 feet bonfire within 90 feet, which persists for the rest of the encounter. A creature in the area when it appears, a creature that enters the area, and a creature that ends its turn in the area takes **INCIDENTAL** damage. If you create a second bonfire, the first one vanishes.
It is straining to persist the bonfire for long times, thus it is challenging to substitute the need for fire wood while traveling; though at the expense of 1 Effort for the Expedition or 4 SS, you can keep a fire burning for the entire night - though you will be unable to sleep and will suffer the appropriate consequences.
