- [x] Effort
you have 4 effort to power your abilities
spend effort as described (for the scene/fight, sustained while you keep the power running,  and for the expedition)
(an expedition is loosely an adventure; it's a civilization -> wilderness -> civlizaiton round trip, whereupon effort slowly regenerates)
you regain 1 effort per good rest in civilization
you regain 2 System strain per good rest in civilization
- [x] Combat / Turn Order / Actions
reaction and morale rolls do exist (see WWN)
roll initiative with an unmodified d20
main action, move action, any number of free actions on your turn, any number of reactions
you can hold an action with a specific trigger
you can permanently delay your turn to a different initiative (this does not allow you to cheat debuffs on the threat of newspapers)
