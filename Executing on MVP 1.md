likely different monster archetypes?

need archetypes for:
ye ole level 1 goblin -> average joe, slightly offensive
big bad dragon -> boss; TODO does this need graduation by type?
fireball yeeting mage -> artillery
assassin -> maybe just artillery, maybe something more offensive melee
bugbear -> brute
ogre -> burte, possibly elite but not sure
archer -> artillery
knight -> more AC less defence than brute; damage possibly can be the same?
controller wizard -> is just fireball yeet wizard


resulting archetypes:
- Artillery (fireball mage, archer)
- Boss (dragon, beholder and more)
- Brute (ogre, bugbear, giant)
- "soldier" (brute -hp +ac) (armored fighter)
- average joe monster (goblin, bandit, beasts)

MVP Objective:
- Artiillery (maybe not even needed?)
- Average Joe

(the hope is that brute and soldier and possibly something like lurker can fall out of average joe)
a boss monster is just a higher level monster, as are elites


## questions to ask of the monster math
answer the questions for each encounter type:
- single boss monster
- 6 monster encounter
- Optional: 1 mini boss 2 minion 1 artillery
- Optional: 2 monster encounter

what's an appropriate encounter level for each character level? (TODO: this probably needs a definition? there's consuming a *reasonable* amount of resources, and there's being *killable* with dailies)

following 4 questions for each of top dps, average, lowest
- how fast does an encounter die to daily nova
- how fast does an encounter die to encounter nova
- (average fight duration is probably here though this interacts with the ominous "appropriateness" (not) defined earlier)
- how fast does an encounter die to at will damage

how fast does an encounter focus firing kill:
- a tank?
- average char?
- squishy?

-> can use an interactive observation spreadsheet for manual testing and then use "Data -> Multiple  Operations" to get a table product of 2 inputs somehow
