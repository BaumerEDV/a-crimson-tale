likely different monster archetypes?

need archetypes for:
ye ole level 1 goblin -> average joe, slightly offensive
big bad dragon -> boss; TODO does this need graduation by type?
fireball yeeting mage -> artillery
assassin -> maybe just artillery, maybe something more offensive melee
bugbear -> brute
ogre -> burte, possibly elite but not sure
archer -> artillery
knight -> more AC less defence than brute; damage possibly can be the same?
controller wizard -> is just fireball yeet wizard


resulting archetypes:
- Artillery (fireball mage, archer)
- Boss (dragon, beholder and more)
- Brute (ogre, bugbear, giant)
- "soldier" (brute -hp +ac) (armored fighter)
- average joe monster (goblin, bandit, beasts)

MVP Objective:
- Artiillery
- Average Joe

(the hope is that brute and soldier and possibly something like lurker can fall out of average joe)
a boss monster is just a higher level monster, as are elites
